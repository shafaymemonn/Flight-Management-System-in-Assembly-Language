# Flight-Management-System-in-Assembly-Language

Introduction:

The Flight Management System implemented in assembly language provides a user-friendly interface to manage various aspects of flight operations. This system is designed to demonstrate key functionalities like displaying flight schedules, booking flights, and canceling bookings. It effectively utilizes basic assembly language programming concepts to perform interactive tasks with user input, data handling, and system output.

This project is a practical application of assembly language principles and provides a foundation for understanding how low-level programming can be used for real-world applications.

Main Functionalities:

Display Flight Schedule:
- Users can view a list of available flights with their respective IDs and routes.
- The system presents a well-formatted flight schedule, including popular routes like:
  - Karachi to Islamabad
  - Islamabad to Karachi
  - Islamabad to Peshawar, etc.

Flight Booking:
- Users can book flights by entering their name and selecting the desired flight ID.
- A receipt is generated for each successful booking, including:
  - Passenger Name
  - Selected Flight Details
  - Total Cost
- The system confirms each booking and provides real-time feedback.

Cancel Booking:
- If needed, users can cancel their bookings with a simple menu option.
- Upon cancellation, the system provides a confirmation message.

Interactive Main Menu:
- Users are presented with a menu containing four options:
  1. Show Flight Schedule
  2. Book Flight
  3. Cancel Flight
  4. Exit
- Invalid inputs are handled gracefully, redirecting users back to the main menu.

Exit Program:
- The system allows users to terminate the program using the 'Exit' option.
